this is file contain steps to achieve transfer s3 object from one bucket to antoher bucket in another account (same region).

1. Create two AWS S3 buckets in two separate accounts.
    2. Create an AWS IAM policy in the destination account that will allow reading the source bucket and writing the destination bucket.
    3. Create an IAM user in the destination account, and connect to the IAM policy.
    4. Create a bucket-policy that will allow the destination account to get objects from the source bucket.
    5. Copy the objects from the source bucket to the destination bucket, using the AWS CLI.

Copying an Object from the Source Bucket to the Destination Bucket

using sso creds if you have or else create access key and scret access key of destination account
In Windows you can set the keys as follows:
SET AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<TOEKN> SET AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<TOKEN>

In Linux/Unix machines or Mac, you can set the keys as follows:
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<TOKEN> export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<TOKEN>

Now, copy the objects from source to destination:
aws s3 sync s3://uadmin-sourcebucket s3://uadmin-destinationbucket

Done! Nothing to sport!!
